### Steps:
    - partitioning, 
    - dividing, 
    - fetching, 
    - and then labeling 
    - and later using that information to train various ML models have indeed addressed numerous business problems

This is a basic, but a pivotal and significant application of Image Classification, where the algorithm was able to capture only the required components from an image, and those pixels were later being classified as the good, the bad, and the ugly by the system

### Problems Solved:
- A facial recognition system implements image segmentation, 
    - identifying an employee and enabling them to mark their attendance automatically. 
    - Segmentation in Image Processing is being used in the medical industry for efficient and faster diagnosis, detecting diseases, tumors, and cell and tissue patterns from various medical imagery generated from radiography, MRI, endoscopy, thermography, ultrasonography, etc.

- Satellite images are processed to identify:
    - various patterns, 
    - objects, 
    - geographical contours, 
    - soil information etc., 
    
    which can be later used for agriculture, mining, geo-sensing, etc. 
    
- Image segmentation has a massive application area in robotics, 
    - like RPA, 
    - self-driving cars, etc. 
    
- Security images can be processed to detect: 
    - harmful objects, 
    - threats, 
    - people 
    - and incidents.

- food processing factory, 
    - where tomatoes on a fast-moving conveyer belt were being inspected by a computer. 
    - It was taking high-speed images from a suitably placed camera and it was passing instructions to a suction robot which was pick up rotten ones, unripe ones, basically, damaged tomatoes and allowing the good ones to pass on.

### Benefits. 
- Colossal impact on that business 
    â€“ eradicating human effort, 
    - human error 
    - and increasing efficiency.

Image Segmentation is very widely implemented in Python, along with other classical languages like Matlab, C/C++ etc. More likey so, Image segmentation in python has been the most sought after skill in the data science stack.
