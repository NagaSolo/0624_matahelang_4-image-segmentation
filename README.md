### Idea
- Computer Vision Project Idea â€“ Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments
- It is very useful in finding meanings from the image
- They are used in object detection of self-driving cars.

### Progress
- Tech Stack - `WIP`
    CV - from scratch, not viable
    OpenCV - buggy, deps hell -> good side is tons of resources
    LibCV etc - not intuitive
    SimpleCV - `TBD`
